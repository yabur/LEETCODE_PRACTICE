is this a graph problem?
     yes, says undirected graph in the title

would a traversal help?
    traversals, explore a connected component and this is find # of 
    connected component, so yes.

What's the extention on top of base dfs/bfs?
     count the number of traversals

code it up


Coding it up:
     1. Do we need to turn the graph into something we can traversE?
          Build the graph

               edgelist -> adj_list

     2. outer loop?
          do we need a loop organizing when we run dfs/bfs?

          Yes, Beause we need to for sure visit every node in the graph.
          Do we need to run multiple traversals?
          yes.

          Shortest path problem example of single traversal problem.
           (path)
